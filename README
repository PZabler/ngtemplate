ngtemplate - A template engine written in C designed to be syntax-compatible with Google CTemplate

Version 0.1-ish, so there's plenty more work to do. 

Introduction
------------

ngtemplate is a small, fast template engine written in C.  Like Google's CTemplate, it
strives to be as simple as possible to shield developers from the temptation of embedding
logic inside their templates.  An example of an ngtemplate would be:

    Hello, {{Name}}.  You have read {{NumPosts}} posts on our blog today.  Thank you for visiting!

When combined with the following dictionary:

Name=John
NumPosts=7

The engine will emit the following string as output:

    Hello, John.  You have read 7 posts on our blog today.  Thank you for visiting!

Installing
----------

To use ngtemplate:
	- Install CMake if you don't have it
	- Clone the git repository
	- cd ngtemplate
	- git submodule init
	- git submodule update
	- mkdir build
	- cd build
	- cmake ../src
	- make
	- make test
	
If all went well you should have libngtemplate.a and libuseful.a in your build directory

NOTE: CMake-less compilation and binary distributions will come eventually

Differences from CTemplate
--------------------------

	- ngtemplate is a little more dynamic than CTemplate.  You are allowed to set variable_missing and 
      modifier_missing callbacks to populate templates dynamically rather than stuffing variable
      values in a data dictionary ahead of time (or some combination of the two approaches).  This
      allows neat tricks similar to the magic you can pull off with Ruby's method_missing
	- Unlike in CTemplate, you can have as many FOO_separator sections as you like inside a template 
	  and they will all be expanded in the order in which the separators are placed
	- Block scope for marker identifiers works even for template includes.  In other words, if an
      included template references a marker not in the include template's dictionary, it will be found
      if the including template has a dictionary entry with that name

Known Issues and Limitations for Version 0.1
--------------------------------------------

	- You cannot currently specify search directories for templates.  Calls to 
      template_set_filename() need to have absolute or resolvable relative paths to the template file
	- Pragmas (including AUTOESCAPE) are not currently supported
	- Modifier support is not yet as capable as CTemplate:
		- Modifiers are supported, but none are currently built-in
		- Modifiers are supported on values only, not sections or includes
		- Modifiers do not currently support arguments
	- Per-expand-data and custom emitters are not currently supported
	- Custom delimiters are supported (via {{= =}}), but they cannot be more than 8 characters long
	- Repeatedly generating output from the same template is slower than it needs to be, because we 
      do not parse the source template into an internal data structure before processing
