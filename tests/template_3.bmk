This is a test of sections.
1, 2, 


	
	Welcome to my section!


Some stuff outside of the section.  Here's a variable name: decl


	Here is a section that will be repeated multiple times
	1.0
	2.0
	3.0
	That other thing
	
		One = "One",
		Two = "Two"
	

	Here is a section that will be repeated multiple times
	"one dot oh"
	"two dot oh"
	LastThree
	That other thing again
	
		One = "One",
		Two = "Two"
	


Now let's test scoping:


	We should be able to see variable: decl because it's in the parent
	template.  Also:
	
	"One"
	"Two"
	This is KeyThree <-- Should be "3.0" in the first section, but "LastThree" in the second 
	
	But we should not be able to see , because it's in a child section


How about an empty section:



Or a non-empty section with no corresponding entry in the dictionary





Lastly, LastThree should now be "LastThree"
