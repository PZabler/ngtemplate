This is a test of sections.
1, 2 


	
	Welcome to my section!


Some stuff outside of the section.  Here's a variable name: decl


	Here is a section that will be repeated multiple times
	1.0
	2.0
	3.0
	That other thing

	Here is a section that will be repeated multiple times
	"one dot oh"
	"two dot oh"
	LastThree
	That other thing again


Now let's test scoping:


	We should be able to see variable: decl because it's in the parent
	template.  Also:
	
	"One"
	"Two"
	This is KeyThree <-- Should be "This is KeyThree", not "LastThree"
	
	But we should not be able to see , because it's in a child section


Lastly, LastThree should now be "LastThree"
