This template tests include sections


Nothing should be between these arrows ---><---


This is a template section.  Key = This is a key and One = One

	Here's another line of the section


Just to make sure: Foo = Bar <--- should be "Foo = Bar"


A person:
-----------------------------------------------
Name:	John
Age:	21
	
	Favorite Color = Black
	Favorite Band = Pearl Jam
	Favorite Sport = Football
	
	
	This is a template section.  Key = This is a key and One = One
	
		Here's another line of the section
	
	
	"Yay, I can finally drink beer!"
-----------------------------------------------

Again, but should be indented:
	-----------------------------------------------
	Name:	John
	Age:	21
		
		Favorite Color = Black
		Favorite Band = Pearl Jam
		Favorite Sport = Football
		
		
		This is a template section.  Key = This is a key and One = One
		
			Here's another line of the section
		
		
		"Yay, I can finally drink beer!"
	-----------------------------------------------



Just to make sure again: Foo = Bar <--- should be "Foo = Bar"
Done.
