Foo=Bar
One=Two
BigText=Oh man is this a bunch of big text that keeps going and going and going and going and going on an on and on and on ad infinitum, well probably not "ad infinitum", but close.  Say, what happens if we do {{ THIS }} ?  Probably nothing, but we should check anyway huh?


Escapes=This should work: = { } !			

!

// This is a test of a template

This should be copied verbatim.  But Foo = Bar

Also, One = Two, but that's kind weird, huh?

What happens if we insert a  that doesn't exist?

Even better, what happens we insert a bunch of crap like "Oh man is this a bunch of big text that keeps going and going and going and going and going on an on and on and on ad infinitum, well probably not "ad infinitum", but close.  Say, what happens if we do {{ THIS }} ?  Probably nothing, but we should check anyway huh?".  Hopefully that works!

This formatted string: (42, 3.141590, 0xdeadbeef, A String, Another String some more -72) comes directly from the test code using the 
template_string_stringf() function.

This should be an integer: 12345
